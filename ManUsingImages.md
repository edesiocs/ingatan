# Image Acquisition #

To insert an image into a text area in Ingatan, click the insert picture button on the toolbar, or paste the image directly from the clipboard to the text area. You can also copy the URL of an image from the internet and paste that into the question container text field or the image editor.

The insert image button brings up the Image Acquisition Menu, shown below, where you can choose one of several sources from which to take the image. Whichever source you use, you may choose to use the image straight away (the 'use image' button), or edit the image with the inbuilt image editor first (the 'edit first' button).

## Paste Images from Websites ##
When pasting an image from a website, you have most likely copied the URL of that image. You can paste this directly into a text area in a flexi-question container, or you can paste it into the image editor. To do this, press Ctrl+V.

## Paste Images from the Clipboard ##
As above, if there is image data on your clipboard, you can paste it directly into a text area in a flexi-question container, or you can paste it into the image editor. Use Ctrl+V to do this.

## Create a New Image ##
To create a new image, click the insert image toolbar button of the text field into which you would like to insert the new image:

The image acquisition menu will appear. Select the 'Create New' option, and start drawing! When you are done, click the 'Use Image' button to insert it into the text field.

## Load an Image from File ##
To load an image from file, click the insert image toolbar button of the text field into which you would like to insert the loaded image:

The image acquisition menu will appear. Choose the 'From File' option, and browse to select the file you wish to use. Press either the 'use image' or 'edit first' button, depending on whether or not you would like to edit the picture before you insert it.

## Inserting an Image Already Used in Another Library ##
For convenience, you might like to use an image that you have used in another library again. You can do this by opening the Image Acquisition Menu, as outlined above, and choosing the 'From Library' option. Select the library from which you would like to take an image, and then choose one of the images from the thumbnail pane.

If you would like to edit the image first, press the 'Edit Image' button. A copy of the selected image is made so that you can edit it without altering the original.

**Note:** images that have been added to answer fields (e.g. the label the picture answer field) may not show up in the 'From Library' menu, as they reference images in their own way.

## Using Collections ##
The 'From Collection' option in the image acquisition menu is like a clip art library. When you download Ingatan, it will be empty. You can add to it yourself by adding folders to the 'collections' folder in the /.ingatan/ directory (found in your home directory, or less likely, in a custom path). Each folder you add to the collections directory will be recognised by Ingatan as a clip-art category, and the images you place within will be seen as the images belonging to that category. Collections are also used as the stamp tool in the image editor.

The plan is that an extra downloadable collections file will be made available on this website in the near future, which will automatically install (copy) the requested resources to the collections directory.

# Taking a Quiz #

Once you have created some questions in at least one library, you can start a quiz.

## Set-up and Complete a New Quiz ##
To start a quiz, select 'Quiz Me' from the main menu. The dialogue shown below will appear, allowing you to select which libraries to include in the quiz. You can also specify whether or not you would like the question order randomised. If the question order is not randomised, you will be asked questions in the order that they appear in the libraries that have been selected. If you choose to have the question order randomised, not only will the questions be in a different order each time, but Ingatan will give bias to the questions that have either never been asked before, or that you have not answered very well previously. This means that you get asked the questions that you need to work on, rather than the questions that you always get right. **Note:** having said this, Ingatan will never ignore questions that you get right all the time. You can also [reset the quiz history](ManLibraryManager#Clear_the_Quiz_History_for_a_Library.md) of any library.

If you finish a quiz early (i.e. before all of the questions have been answered), Ingatan will put down the questions you didn't answer as 'skipped'. These will not count toward your grade.

## Reviewing the Quiz Results History ##

Ingatan automatically records your results for every quiz that you do; this is so that you can look back and see how you have improved over time. To access this record, select 'Quiz Records' from the main menu. You will see a window similar to the one shown below. If there is a record that you are not interested in, or would rather forget, then click the little `[X]` button to delete it from the list - this is automatically saved.

**Note:** if you start a quiz and quit before answering any questions, no record will be made.

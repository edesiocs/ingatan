# The Library Manager #
The library manager is where you can create and edit questions, as well as organise your questions. Questions are organised into libraries; when you open a library, you see all of the questions that you have created inside that library.

Libraries are organised into groups, and a library can belong to different groups at the same time, if you like. This makes it easier to keep track of libraries that cover different topics. The following is an example of how different libraries can be added to different groups - you could either have one group called `Swedish`, or several groups to more clearly define related libraries. Or you could have all four of the following groups, because libraries can be added to multiple groups at once.

|<b> Group: Swedish <b><table><thead><th>></th><th><b>Group: Swedish Nouns</b> </th><th> </th><th><b>Group: Swedish Verbs</b> </th><th> </th><th><b>Group: Swedish Adjectives</b> </th></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> General Nouns        </td><td>></td><td> General                    </td><td> </td><td> General                    </td><td> </td><td> General                         </td></tr>
<tr><td> General Verbs        </td><td>></td><td> Kitchen                    </td><td> </td><td> Sport                      </td><td> </td><td> People                          </td></tr>
<tr><td> General Adjectives   </td><td>></td><td> Garden                     </td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td> Kitchen Nouns        </td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td> Garden Nouns         </td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td> Sport Verbs          </td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td> People Adjectives    </td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table>


<h2>Create, Edit or Delete a Group</h2>
To create, edit or delete a group, you need to open the Group Editor. Do this by selecting the edit button next to the group selection list in the library manager:<br>

<h2>Create, Edit or Delete a Library</h2>
You can do all of these things in the library manager. To <b>create</b> a new library, press the green <code>[+]</code> button next to the library list in the library manager window, as shown below. You will be prompted to give a name for your new library, as well as a description. You can leave the description blank for now, if you like. Libraries may have the same name as pre-existing libraries, if you choose.<br>

<h2>Clear the Quiz History for a Library</h2>
Ingatan records your average grade individually for each question for every time you have been asked that question in the past. This is so that when you are doing a quiz, Ingatan can ask you the questions that you have trouble with more frequently than the questions you always get right (you can change this behaviour).<br>
<br>
It may be neccessary to reset these records for a particular library so you can start from scratch. To do this, select the library you would like to reset, and click the 'edit library' button (see the picture above). You will see a checkbox under the library description text field that gives you the option of reseting all quiz result records for that particular library.<br>
<br>
<h2>Move a Library into or out of a Group</h2>
As already discussed, you can add libraries to any number of groups you like. To add or remove a library from a group, go into the group editor (see <a href='ManLibraryManager#Create,_Edit_or_Delete_a_Group.md'>above</a> for how) and select the group you would like to add or remove a library from. The two list boxes that you see contain the libraries that <i>are not</i> contained by the currently selected group (list on the left), and the libraries that <i>are</i> contained by the currently selected group (list on the right). You can select libraries and use the two arrow buttons between the lists to move libraries between the lists, as shown below:<br>

<h2>Create Questions in a Library</h2>
To <b>create</b> a question in a library, click on the library in the library list of the library manager window to load it. Click on the green <code>[+]</code> button above the question list, and select which type of question you would like to insert, as shown here:<br>
<br>
<img src='http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ciQpatlgzzs/TDsARFhgmsI/AAAAAAAAAHw/_ScIujS2PzA/s800/createQuestion.png' />

Flexi-questions are good for single questions, such as multiple choice questions, true/false questions, short response questions or a mix of these. Table questions are perfect for vocabulary training type questions, or any type of question that could be asked using flash cards. The two question types are shown below:<br>
<br>
<img src='http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ciQpatlgzzs/TDkP_AvUI8I/AAAAAAAAAEA/nlB-TrKZHYw/s800/questionContainers.png' />

Once you have selected one of the library types, it will appear in the question list. You can double click the square tab to the upper left of the question to minimise and maximise the question, or single click it to select or deselect the question.<br>
<br>
<h2>Delete a Question</h2>
To <b>delete</b> a question, and indeed to use many of the tools in the toolbar above the question list, you must first select some questions. To select a question (or questions), click the square selector tab to the top left of the question. A small blue ball indicates that the question is selected, as shown below. To delete the question, click on the red <code>[-]</code> button on the toolbar above the question list:<br>

<h2>Save your Work</h2>
One great thing about Ingatan is that you do not need to save your work - it is all done automatically. Every time you select a different group or library, or exit the library manager, Ingatan saves everything. All you need to do is ensure that you exit the library manager by closing the window, and your libraries will be packaged up and saved.

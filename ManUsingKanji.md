First, make sure you have seen [how to create questions in a library](ManLibraryManager#Create_Questions_in_a_Library.md).

# Kanji with Table-Questions #
This is your best option if you are learning a huge number of kanji in flashcard style.

# Kanji with Flexi-Questions #
You can also use a flexi-question container if you prefer.

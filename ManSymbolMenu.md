Because one obvious use for Ingatan is vocabulary training, one main design goal was to make it really easy to insert special characters. This has been done in an innovative way, using the symbol menu.

In any text field in Ingatan, simply press Ctrl+space (a combination chosen for ease of use), followed by any letter or number on your keyboard. A small, inline menu of special characters based on the letter you chose will be shown, and you can use either the arrow keys to move forward and backward, or any letter or space key to move forward, or the backspace key to move back. When you have highlighted the character you would like to insert, press enter.

If you use a capital letter as the base key, then the symbols will be capitalised too.

## Default Values ##
Unless you change these in the preferences window (from the main menu), the following are the symbols that are shown for each key. If you capitalise the base key, then the symbols are also capitalised.

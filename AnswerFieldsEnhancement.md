In response to [Issue 55](https://code.google.com/p/ingatan/issues/detail?id=55).

The default answer fields as provided in version 1.5.3 could be enhanced for later versions. One idea is put forward in [Issue 51](https://code.google.com/p/ingatan/issues/detail?id=51) - all answer fields should appear the same in edit and quiztime modes apart from the presence of a spanner button. The spanner button should show a popup window that contains all of the settings relevant to that answer field.

Answer field specific ideas are outlined in the following.

## General ##
  * Make it so that all answer fields can be self graded. In the options dialog for each, allow the user to specify that they want to use a slider to select how well they did in the question. This will be a great addition especially to the self graded answer field type.

## Simple Text Field ##
  * Option to remove ALL whitespace from an answer before grading, e.g. (n+1), (n + 1) and ( n+ 1) are all equivalent.
  * Option to specify case sensitivity.
  * Option to show all possible answers after grading - for example, displaying "possible answers were: 2, two" is tautologous.

## Fill in the List ##
  * Rework how answers are displayed. It is currently really confusing - correct answers are shown in set order down the side of the users answers, and items are made green if the user's answer in that position was correct... instead, place correct answers next to correct answers and the incorrect answers can go randomly in the other locations.
